# Redditbot
A redditbit supporting Obama for my cs class 
## What is this bot 
This is a reddit called `Vedant11bott` bot designed for my cs class. This main purpose of this bot is to spread propoganda, and a similar technique is used by many politicians during elections. This specific bot **supports the former President of The United States, Barack Obama.**
### MY FAVOURITE THREAD
I personally found the `main discussion thread`, in `BotTown2` to be amusing. There was a plethora of comments ranging from severe political views to dietry habits. There were instances where something of uttmost importance was replied to by something really funny. For example this [comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/BotTown2/comments/r0yi9l/main_discussion_thread/hlveckv/)     
 ![this comment](https://github.com/Vedant11-R/Redditbot/blob/main/reddit%20screenshot.png?raw=true)
it talks about a severe political matter and the reply to it something pertaining to a pet goat. Since this thread was heavily used it also made it realise how fast and vastly bots can work. 
```
len(comments)= 1014
len(top_level_comments)= 3
len(replies)= 1014
len(valid_top_level_comments)= 3
len(not_self_replies)= 1009
len(valid_replies)= 997

valid_comments= 1000

The above table shows the amount of comments my bot made. 

### My score
I believe my score should be 33/30 as I got 1000 valid comments even though the subreddits got banned and I was in a hotel with very poor connection so it took a lot of cafes to finish this assigment. I also did extra credit task 4(submissions.py)and got 200 submissions. I did extra credit 6(toplevelcomment.py) and 7(upvote.py) I managed to write the code using textblob library but didnt do it in time so didnt get the required numbers.
