A redditbit supporting Obama for my cs class 
## What is this bot 
This is a reddit called `Vedant11bott` bot designed for my cs class. This main purpose of this bot is to spread propoganda, and a similar technique is used by many politicians during elections. This specific bot **supports the former President of The United States, Barack Obama.**
### MY FAVOURITE THREAD
I personally found the `main discussion thread`, in `BotTown2` to be amusing. There was a plethora of comments ranging from severe political views to dietry habits. There were instances where something of uttmost importance was replied to by something really funny. For example this [comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/BotTown2/comments/r0yi9l/main_discussion_thread/hlveckv/)     
 ![this comment](https://github.com/Vedant11-R/Redditbot/blob/main/reddit%20screenshot.png?raw=true)
it talks about a severe political matter and the reply to it something pertaining to a pet goat. Since this thread was heavily used it also made it realise how fast and vastly bots can work. 
```

The above table shows the amount of comments my bot made. 

### My score
I believe my score should be 33/30 as I over 300 valid comments on the BotTown but as soon as I landed in New York I had 0 valid comments. Its been really difficult to keep running the file as the wifi in the hotel is terrible and i had to sit in cafes for hours just tp get the required comments. After hitting 960 (I recorded it as didnt wanna risk losing this record too) my valid comments started decreasing so I stopped running the file. I also did extra credit task 4(submissions.py)and got 200 submissions. I did extra credit 6(toplevelcomment.py) and 7(upvote.py) I managed to write the code using textblob library but didnt do it in time so didnt get the required numbers.
